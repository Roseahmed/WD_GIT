Different stages of git Version Control:-
a)current working directory/space.
b)stagging area.
c)Local Repository(.git).
d)Remote Repository(github).


/*Process for creating git version Control

git init; //for creating git to current working directory.
git add filename; //for adding get into staging area.
git status; //for checking the file is added to staging area or not.
git commit -m "commit message better to give in peresent tense"; //for committing the file.
git diff filename; //for checking the changes made in file.
         OR 
git show commit_id; //for checking chages made in the file.
git log; //for displaying all commit.
      OR
git log --oneline; //for displaying commit in one line.
*/



/*Ignore files in Current Working for git version Control

1.create hidden file like: touch .gitignore;
2.open the file and write which file you want to ignore for version control like:
*.cpp; //it will ignore all the cpp files.
*.c;  //it will ignore all the c files.
3.Add the file in staging area.
4.Commit the file.
*/


/*Process for creating branch

git branch; //for checking the total no of branches and to which branch it is pointing.
git branch newBranchName; //for greating new branch.
git checkout branchName_to_which_you_want_to_Work; //for switching to different branch.
N.B:-New file creation or modificiation in branch will also reflect in master branch until it is added in staging area and committed.
*/


/*Process for merging different branches in master branch

1.First go the branch to which you want merge with usally master branch like:- git checkout master;
2.git merge branchName_to_which_you_want_to_merge_with_master.
         
         Merge Conflict
when same file having different content in different branches if you do merge conflict occures.

solution:Just open the file with vi editor and edit the content and then add and commit the file.
*/


/*Process for adding tag to commit

git tag -a tagname -m "tagmessage" commit_id; //for adding tag name to commit.
git tag; //For dispyaing tag.
git tag -d tagname; //for removing the tag.
N.B:- Tag is alternative for commit_id.
*/


/*Process for removing file from workspace,staging area and commit

git restore fileName; //for removing file from working space.
git restore --staged fileName; //for removing file from stagging area.
git reset --mixed HEAD~1(no of last commit you want to remove); //remove the last one commit put it working space, --mixed is default reset.
git reset --soft HEAD~2; //remove the last two commit and put it in staging area.
git reset --hard HEAD~3; //remove the last three commit completely from all three stages.
N.B:-Use reset for local repository only,and reset command is not recommended for public or remote repository(github).
*/


/*Process for reverting previous commit

1.git revert commit_id; //for reverting previous commit
2.It will automatically open nano editor.
3.Just add the commitMessage and save the commit and exit.
*/


/*Process for deleting untracked files 

git clean -n; //It will dispaly all the untracked file that should remove.
git clean -f; //It will remove all the untracked file/directory.
*/


/*Process for moving any work to stash
N.B:- For moving file in stash the file should be at least commited once.
git stash; //for moving the modification file from working area to stash.
git stash list; //for displaying list and list_id of stash file.
git stash appy list_id; //for bringing back the data/file to working directory.
git stash clear; //for clear the item copied in stash area.
*/ 


/*Process for pushing Local Repository to github

git remote add origin [anyname] link_of_github_Repository; 
git branch -M main/master;
git push -u origin main/master;
*/

/*Process for pulling code from remote Repository(github)

git remote add origin Link_of_github_Repository.
git pull origin master.
*/

/*Process for cloning github Repository to local directory
git clone Link_Of_Repository.
*/
